# Decision-Tree-Algoritham
#PROJECT TITLE:

Prediction of iris.csv data set for decision tree algoritham using supervise learning and machine algoritham.

#PROBLEM STATEMENT:

American based botonical gardens grow iris flower in their labs but using bio-technology in a single tree different varities of flowers are grown As a datascience engineer find out accuracy of all categories of flowers contain same species.

#Conclusion:

According to the models analysis Decision Tree algoritham work for only 1% Species
